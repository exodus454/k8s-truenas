[democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi) based simple guide to use Kubernetes cluster with TrueNAS Scale over API. 

You can use democratic-csi documentation and achieve the same results but the reason I created this guide is the fact that democratic-csi docs are covering multiple awkward combinations of various technologies and if you just want to have NFS/iSCSI over API then the whole setup guide can be much simpler.
